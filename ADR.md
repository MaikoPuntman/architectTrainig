Recommended Deployment Model – Hybrid Cloud Centralized Architecture
Why Hybrid Cloud?
•	Cost Reduction: Move commoditized workloads to the cloud for elasticity and pay-per-use, keep sensitive or high-performance workloads on-premises.
•	Revenue Growth: Cloud-native services speed up product launches and scale dynamically for seasonal demand.
•	Standardization: Centralized governance ensures all deployments follow the same tech stack, security, and integration rules.

Deployment Model Structure
1. Centralized Core Platforms (Cloud + On-Premises)
•	ERP, CRM, Data Lake: Hosted in a centralized, standardized environment (cloud-first, but can be hybrid).
•	Shared APIs & Integration Layer: API gateway for secure and consistent service exposure across business units.
•	Identity & Access Management (IAM): Single sign-on, role-based access, applied globally.
2. Regional / Departmental Access
•	Access to core systems via standardized APIs and thin client apps.
•	Local caching and edge computing for latency-sensitive workloads.
3. Migration & Integration Layer
•	ETL & Data Sync Pipelines: For moving data from legacy systems to standardized platforms.
•	Event Bus / Messaging System: Enables real-time integration and decouples services.
4. Governance & Monitoring
•	Central Monitoring Dashboards: Unified metrics on cost, performance, and adoption.
•	Security Compliance Controls: Enforce policies (GDPR, ISO, etc.) across the board.


1. Context
Our organization currently operates multiple IT systems across different departments, regions, and business units. These systems often provide overlapping functionalities, use different technology stacks, and require separate licensing, support contracts, and skill sets.
The lack of standardization results in:
•	Higher operational costs (maintenance, licensing, integration overhead)
•	Slower time-to-market for new products and features
•	Inconsistent customer experience
•	Reduced ability to leverage economies of scale
The goal is to reduce costs and increase revenue by standardizing IT systems, processes, and tools to a common architecture.

2. Decision
We will standardize our IT systems by:
•	Consolidating overlapping platforms into a unified set of core systems
•	Defining and enforcing a common technology stack
•	Implementing standardized APIs and integration patterns
•	Migrating legacy applications into modern, cloud-based standardized platforms
•	Using centralized governance for architecture decisions

3. Rationale
Cost Reduction:
•	Licensing Savings: Fewer systems → fewer vendor contracts and license costs.
•	Maintenance Efficiency: Reduced need for multiple support teams and skill sets.
•	Infrastructure Optimization: Shared hosting/cloud infrastructure reduces duplication.
•	Process Streamlining: Standardized processes reduce operational overhead.
Revenue Increase:
•	Faster Innovation: Standard platforms enable quicker rollout of new products/features.
•	Cross-Selling Opportunities: Unified systems allow better data integration for personalized offers.
•	Improved Customer Experience: Consistent UX and service reliability encourage repeat business.
•	Scalable Growth: Easier onboarding of new markets or acquisitions into the standardized environment.

4. Consequences
Positive:
•	Lower total cost of ownership (TCO)
•	Improved operational efficiency
•	Enhanced cross-team collaboration
•	Stronger vendor negotiation power due to consolidated spend
•	Better analytics from unified data
Negative / Risks:
•	Initial migration cost and disruption
•	Potential loss of specific niche functionalities from legacy systems
•	Resistance to change from teams used to current tools
•	Risk of standardizing on suboptimal tools if requirements evolve

5. Alternatives Considered
1.	Continue with current heterogeneous systems
o	Pros: No migration disruption, no retraining costs
o	Cons: Continued high costs, limited scalability, poor integration
2.	Partial standardization (by department or region)
o	Pros: Lower migration risk, more flexibility
o	Cons: Limited cost savings, partial integration benefits
3.	Full IT system standardization (selected option)
o	Pros: Maximum cost savings, integration benefits, and revenue growth potential
o	Cons: Higher short-term investment and migration effort

6. Implementation Plan
1.	System Inventory & Assessment – Identify overlapping and redundant systems.
2.	Technology Selection – Choose standardized platforms, tools, and stacks.
3.	Migration Roadmap – Plan phased transition to minimize business disruption.
4.	Governance Setup – Create Architecture Review Board to enforce standards.
5.	Change Management – Provide training, documentation, and stakeholder communication.
6.	Continuous Improvement – Periodically review and update standards.
