MuleSoft Integration Architect’s Glossary
A
API-Led Connectivity – MuleSoft’s approach to integration that organizes APIs into three layers: System, Process, and Experience.
Anypoint Platform – The unified platform for designing, building, deploying, and managing APIs and integrations.
API Strategy – The high-level plan for exposing, securing, and governing APIs to meet business goals.
Application Network – A collection of APIs and integrations that connect data, applications, and devices in a reusable way.

C
Center for Enablement (C4E) – A cross-functional team model that drives API reuse and best practices across the organization.
CloudHub – MuleSoft’s managed cloud runtime for deploying and scaling Mule applications.
Consumer (API Consumer) – Any application or system that uses an API, often tracked for governance.

D
Design-First Approach – Building API specifications before development to ensure alignment and reuse.
Discovery – Locating existing APIs and assets in Anypoint Exchange to avoid duplication.
Distributed Integration – Architecting integrations across multiple cloud and on-premises environments.

E
Experience API – API layer designed to meet specific user experience needs by aggregating and transforming data from process APIs.
Environment Strategy – The architectural plan for separating and managing dev, test, and production deployments.

F
Failover – Architectural design to switch to backup systems when a failure occurs.
Federated Governance – Governance model where central policies coexist with domain-specific flexibility.

G
Governance – The policies, processes, and controls for managing APIs and integrations securely and consistently.

H
Hybrid Deployment – Running Mule applications both in the cloud and on-premises in a coordinated architecture.
High Availability (HA) – Designing integrations so they remain operational even during system or node failures.

I
Integration Pattern – Reusable solution templates for common integration problems (e.g., pub-sub, request-reply, batch processing).
Ingestion – The process of bringing data from multiple sources into an integration flow.

L
Load Balancing – Distributing API or integration traffic evenly across multiple instances or nodes.

M
Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) – Middleware that sends messages between distributed systems, often via JMS or AMQP.
Monitoring – Observing APIs and integrations for performance, errors, and usage trends.

O
On-Premises Integration – Mule runtime deployed inside the organization’s own infrastructure.
Orchestration – Combining multiple API calls and services into a single, cohesive workflow.

P
Policy – Configurable rule applied to APIs for security, throttling, or compliance.
Process API – API layer that encapsulates and orchestrates business processes by consuming System APIs.
Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) – An asynchronous messaging pattern where senders publish messages to topics and subscribers receive them.

R
Rate Limiting – Restricting API call volume to protect backend systems and enforce SLAs.
Resiliency – Architectural ability to handle and recover from failures without data loss.
Runtime Fabric – Containerized deployment architecture for Mule applications across multiple environments.

S
Scalability – The ability to increase throughput by adding more processing resources.
Service Mesh – An architectural layer that manages service-to-service communication, security, and observability.
System API – API layer that provides controlled access to underlying systems of record.

T
Throughput – The volume of transactions an integration or API can process in a given time.
Transformation Layer – Where data formats are converted to meet consumer needs, often implemented with DataWeave.

U
Unified Governance – Applying consistent security and operational policies across all APIs and integrations.
